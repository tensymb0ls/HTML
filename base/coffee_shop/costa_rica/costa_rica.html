                    <h4>Costa Rica</h4>
                    
                    <p>Coffee production in the country began in 1779 in the Meseta Central which had ideal soil and climate conditions for
                    coffee plantations. Coffea arabica first imported to Europe through Arabia, whence it takes its name, was introduced to
                    the country directly from Ethiopia. In the nineteenth century, the Costa Rican government strongly encouraged coffee
                    production, and the industry fundamentally transformed a colonial regime and village economy built on direct extraction
                    by a city-based elite towards organized production for export on a larger scale. The government offered farmers plots of
                    land for anybody who wanted to harvest the plants. The coffee plantation system in the country therefore developed in
                    the nineteenth century largely as result of the government's open policy, although the problem with coffee barons did
                    play a role in internal differentiation and inequality in growth.[2] Soon coffee became a major source of revenue
                    surpassing cacao, tobacco, and sugar production as early as 1829.

                    Coffee production in the country relies on cheap, seasonal labor: Nicaraguan immigrants are often employed on these
                    plantations. Coffee cultivators in the country are paid very little, often as little as US$1.5 per basket picked, but
                    the wages are not less than in many other industries of the Costa Rican primary sectors.[11] The berries are picked by
                    the workers and are transported to processing plants to be washed and to remove the pulp around the beans. In Costa Rica
                    the processing plants where this process is done are called beneficios but the effects of pulp removal may result in
                    non-beneficial environmental effects (see below). The beans are then laid out to dry in the sun, then sorted according
                    to size and shape. Although mechanical drying is gradually replacing manual labor in places, time-consuming sun drying,
                    and equipment are required to dry the wet seeds after pulping.[12] Once processing is complete, the coffee is bagged
                    into burlap sacks (with or without a moisture barrier bag) and stored until exported.

                    Although coffee production in Costa Rica is a major source of revenue, it is not without its environmental problems. The
                    main effect on the environment is the pollution of rivers during the separation and de-pulping process at the beneficio
                    processing plants or mills. After the beans are separated from the pulp, the beans are left to ferment in a water tank
                    to remove the gummy gel that surrounds the bean. By the end of the drying process, there is leftover pulp and sugar
                    water. In the past, many coffee producers dumped the pulp waste directly into the rivers. Approximately 57% of the
                    coffee bean consists of contaminants which destroy wildlife in rivers and may harm people.[citation needed] The pulp as
                    it decays in river water has the effect of depleting the water of oxygen and killing off aquatic life.
