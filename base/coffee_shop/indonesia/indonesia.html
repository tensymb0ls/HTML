                    <p>The Dutch governor in Malabar (India) sent arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) seedlings from Yemen to the Dutch governor of
                    Batavia (now Jakarta) in 1696. The first seedlings failed due to flooding in Batavia. The second shipment of seedlings
                    was sent in 1699 with Hendrik Zwaardecroon.[4] The plants grew, and in 1711 the first exports were sent from Java to
                    Europe by the Dutch East India Company—formally Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie and abbreviated VOC—reaching 2000
                    pounds shipped in 1717.[5] Coffee arriving in Amsterdam sold for high prices, 1 kg (2 lb) costing nearly one per cent of
                    the average annual income.[6] Indonesia was the first place, outside of Arabia and Ethiopia, where coffee was widely
                    cultivated.[7]
                    <br><br>
                    The coffee was shipped to Europe from the port of Batavia (now Jakarta). There has been a port at the mouth of Ciliwung
                    River since 397 AD, when King Purnawarman established the city he called Sunda Kelapa. Today, in the Kota area of
                    Jakarta, one can find echoes of the seagoing legacy that built the city. Sail driven ships still load cargo in the old
                    port. The Bahari museum occupies a former warehouse of the VOC, which was used to store spices and coffee. Menara
                    Syahbandar (or Lookout Tower) was built in 1839 to replace the flag pole that stood at the head of wharves, where the
                    VOC ships docked to load their cargos.[8]
                    <br><br>
                    In the 18th century, coffee shipped from Batavia sold for 3 Guilders per kilogram in Amsterdam. Since annual incomes in
                    Holland in the 18th century were between 200 and 400 Guilders, this was equivalent to several hundred dollars per
                    kilogram today. By the end of the 18th century, the price had dropped to 0.6 Guilders per kilogram and coffee drinking
                    spread from the elite to the general population.[9] The East Indies were the most important coffee supplier in the world
                    during this period and it was only in the 1840s that their stranglehold on supply was eclipsed by Brazil.[7]
                    <br><br><img src="../images/indonesia/content.jpg">
                    The coffee trade was very profitable for the VOC, and for the Dutch East Indies government that replaced it in 1800, but
                    was less so for the Indonesian farmers who were forced to grow it by the colonial government from 1830 to around 1870
                    under the Cultuurstelsel (Cultivation system). Production of export crops were delivered to government warehouses
                    instead of taxes. Coffee, along with sugar and indigo, was one of the main crops produced under this highly exploitative
                    colonial system. Cultuurstelsel was applied to coffee in the Preanger region of West Java, as well as in West Sumatra,
                    South Sulawesi and the Minahasa region of North Sulawesi. This corrupt system, which diverted labor from rice production
                    and caused great hardship for farmers, was immortalized through an influential novel by Eduard Douwes Dekker (pen name -
                    Multatuli) in 1860 titled Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company. This book helped to change
                    Dutch public opinion about the "Cultivation System" and colonialism in general. More recently, the name Max Havelaar was
                    adopted by one of the first fair trade organizations.[9]
                    <br><br>
                    By the mid-1870s the Dutch East Indies expanded arabica coffee-growing areas in Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi and Timor. In
                    Sulawesi the coffee was thought to have been planted around 1850.[10] In North Sumatra highlands coffee was first grown
                    near Lake Toba in 1888, followed in Gayo highland (Aceh) near Lake Laut Tawar in 1924. Coffee at the time was also grown
                    in East Indonesia- East Timor and Flores. Both of these islands were originally under Portuguese control and the coffee
                    was also C. arabica, but from different root stocks. The coffee in Eastern Indonesia was not affected to the same degree
                    by rust, and even today, it is believed that some coffee in East Timor can be traced back to the 18th century.
                    <br><br>
                    In the late eighteen hundreds, Dutch colonialists established large coffee plantations on the Ijen Plateau in eastern
                    Java. However, disaster struck in the 1876, when the coffee rust disease, Hemileia vastatrix, swept through Indonesia,
                    wiping out most of the Arabica Typica cultivar. Robusta coffee (C. canephor var. robusta) was introduced to East Java in
                    1900 as a substitute, especially at lower altitudes, where the rust was particularly devastating. Robusta coffee was
                    introduced to smallholders around Kerinci around 1915, and then spread quickly across southern Sumatra during the 1920s,
                    where production soon eclipsed Java.[5] The region remains the most important producing region by volume today.[11]
                    <br><br>
                    Dutch-owned plantations on Java were nationalized in the 1950s, soon after independence. and are now managed as
                    state-owned plantations under PTPN - Perusahaan Terbatas Perkebunan Nusantara, and revitalized with new varieties of
                    Coffea arabica in the 1950s.[12] These varieties were also adopted by smallholders through the government and various
                    development programs.
