                <p>Brazil produces about a third of the world's coffee, making the country by far the world's largest
                    producer. Coffee
                    plantations, covering some 27,000 km2 (10,000 sq mi), are mainly located in the southeastern states
                    of Minas Gerais, São
                    Paulo and Paraná where the environment and climate provide ideal growing conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    The crop first arrived in Brazil in the 18th century, and the country had become the dominant
                    producer by the 1840s.
                    Brazilian coffee prospered since the early 19th century, when immigrants came to work in the coffee
                    plantations.<br>
                    Production as a share of world coffee output peaked in the 1920s but has declined since the 1950s
                    due to increased
                    global production.

                <p>Coffee production in India is dominated in the hill tracts of South Indian states, with Karnataka
                    accounting for 71%
                    (Kodagu alone produces 33% of India's coffee), followed by Kerala with 21% and Tamil Nadu (5% of
                    overall production with
                    8,200 tonnes). Indian coffee is said to be the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than direct
                    sunlight anywhere in
                    the world.[1] There are about 250,000 coffee growers in the country; 98% of them are small
                    growers.[2] As of 2009,
                    Indian coffee made up just 4.5% of the global production. Almost 80% of Indian coffee is
                    exported;[3] 70% is bound for
                    Germany, Russia, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Greece, Netherlands
                    and France. Italy
                    accounts for 29% of the exports. Most of the export is shipped through the Suez Canal.[1]
                    <br><br>
                    Coffee is grown in three regions of India with Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu forming the
                    traditional coffee growing
                    region, followed by the new areas developed in the non-traditional areas of Andhra Pradesh and
                    Odisha in the eastern
                    coast of the country and with a third region comprising the states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya,
                    Mizoram, Tripura,
                    Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh of Northeastern India, popularly known as "Seven Sister States of
                    India".[4]
                    <br><br>
                    Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern states under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as
                    "Indian monsooned
                    coffee". Its flavour is defined as: "The best Indian coffee reaches the flavour characteristics of
                    Pacific coffees, but
                    at its worst it is simply bland and uninspiring".[5] The two well known species of coffee grown are
                    the Arabica and
                    Robusta. The first variety that was introduced in the Baba Budan Giri hill ranges in Chikmagalur
                    district of Karnataka
                    state in the 17th century[6] was marketed over the years under the brand names of Kent and S.795.

                <p>Coffee production in Ethiopia is a longstanding tradition which dates back dozens of centuries.
                    Ethiopia is where Coffea
                    arabica, the coffee plant, originates.[1] The plant is now grown in various parts of the world;
                    Ethiopia itself accounts
                    for around 3% of the global coffee market. Coffee is important to the economy of Ethiopia; around
                    60% of foreign income
                    comes from coffee, with an estimated 15 million of the population relying on some aspect of coffee
                    production for their
                    livelihood.[1] In 2006, coffee exports brought in $350 million,[2] equivalent to 34% of that year's
                    total exports.[3]</p>

                <p>Coffee production has played a key role in Costa Rica's history and continues to be important to the
                    country's economy.<br>
                    In 2006, coffee was Costa Rica's number three export,[1] after being the number one cash crop export
                    for several
                    decades. In 1997, the agriculture sector employed 28 percent of the labor force and comprised 20
                    percent of Costa Rica's
                    total GNP.[2] Production increased from 158,000 tons in 1988 to 168,000 tons in 1992. The largest
                    growing areas are in
                    the provinces of San José, Alajuela, Heredia, Puntarenas, and Cartago. The coffee is exported to
                    other countries in the
                    world and is also exported to cities in Costa Rica.
                    <br><br>
                    As a small country, Costa Rica now provides under 1% of the world's coffee production.[3] In 2015,
                    the value of its
                    coffee exports was US$305.9 million, a small part of the total agricultural exports of US$2.7
                    billion or of the total of
                    all exports which was US$12.6 billion.[4][5] Coffee production increased by 13.7% percent in
                    2015–2016, declined by
                    17.5% in 2016–2017 but was expected to increase by about 15% in the subsequent year.[6]

                <p>Coffee production in Colombia has a reputation for producing mild, well-balanced coffee
                    beans.[1][2][3][4] Colombia's
                    average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after
                    Brazil and Vietnam,
                    though highest in terms of the arabica bean.[5][6][7][8] The beans are exported to United States,
                    Germany, France,
                    Japan, and Italy.[9] Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region, while other
                    regions focus on
                    quality instead of volumes, such as Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. In 2007, the European Union
                    granted Colombian coffee a
                    protected designation of origin status.[10] In 2011, UNESCO declared the "Coffee Cultural Landscape"
                    of Colombia, a
                    World Heritage site.[11]
                    <br><br>
                    The coffee plant had spread to Colombia by 1790.[12] The oldest written testimony of the presence of
                    coffee in Colombia
                    is attributed to a Jesuit priest, José Gumilla. In his book The Orinoco Illustrated (1730), he
                    registered the presence
                    of coffee in the mission of Saint Teresa of Tabajé, near where the Meta river empties into the
                    Orinoco. Further
                    testimony comes from the archbishop-viceroy Caballero y Gongora (1787) who registered the presence
                    of the crop in the
                    north east of the country near Giron (Santander) and Muzo (Boyaca) in a report that he provided to
                    the Spanish
                    authorities.

                <p>Indonesia was the fourth-largest producer of coffee in the world in 2014.[1] Coffee cultivation in
                    Indonesia began in
                    the late 1600s and early 1700s, in the early Dutch colonial period, and has played an important part
                    in the growth of
                    the country. Indonesia is geographically and climatologically well-suited for coffee plantations,
                    near the equator and
                    with numerous interior mountainous regions on its main islands, creating well-suited microclimates
                    for the growth and
                    production of coffee.
                    <br><br>
                    Indonesia produced an estimated 660,000 metric tons of coffee in 2017.[1] Of this total, it is
                    estimated that 154,800
                    tons were slated for domestic consumption in the 2013–2014 financial year.[2] Of the exports, 25%
                    are arabica beans; the
                    balance is robusta.[3] In general, Indonesia's arabica coffee varieties have low acidity and strong
                    bodies, which make
                    them ideal for blending with higher-acidity coffees from Central America and East Africa.
