                    <h2>Milano</h2>
                    <p>TRN413 class ship.
                        <br><br> Guardians of the Galaxy main spaceship.
                        <br>On Milano, Peter Quill flew to Morag, where he took possession of the Orb. He then traveled
                        to
                        Xandar, where he was
                        arrested by the Nova Corps and sent to the Kyln. Milano was brought there too.

                        Quill later escaped prison with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. On Milano they went to
                        Oblivion, and then to
                        Xandar. During the Battle of Xandar, Rocket crashed into Ronan's spaceship on Milano, causing
                        both ships
                        to crash.
                        <br>
                        After defeating Ronan and in gratitude for saving their planet, the Nova Corps repaired Milano
                        and
                        returned him to
                        Quill.

                        <br> In addition to a host of high-tech equipment, this spaceship has a player for the already
                        rather
                        outdated audio tapes
                        with magnetic tape.
