            <p>TRN413 class ship.
                <br><br> Guardians of the Galaxy main spaceship.
                <br>On Milano, Peter Quill flew to Morag, where he took possession of the Orb. He then traveled
                to
                Xandar, where he was
                arrested by the Nova Corps and sent to the Kyln. Milano was brought there too.
    
                Quill later escaped prison with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. On Milano they went to
                Oblivion, and then to
                Xandar. During the Battle of Xandar, Rocket crashed into Ronan's spaceship on Milano, causing
                both ships
                to crash.
                <br>
                After defeating Ronan and in gratitude for saving their planet, the Nova Corps repaired Milano
                and
                returned him to
                Quill.
    
                <br> In addition to a host of high-tech equipment, this spaceship has a player for the already
                rather
                outdated audio tapes
                with magnetic tape.
